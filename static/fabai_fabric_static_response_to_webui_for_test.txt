## QUOTES:

- "You can get these amazingly powerful learning algorithms that are very generic couple them with very large amounts of compute couple them with very large amounts of data and magic things started to happen when you compi those ingredients."
- "The big unlock is compute like I know the story of AI is of in the story of compute but even no matter how much people talk about it I I think people underestimate it right and the amount of the amount of growth that we've seen in computational power over the last decade is astounding"
- "The bitter lesson says is if you make an algorithm don't be cute yeah just make sure you can take advantage of available compute because the available compute will show up right and so like you just like need to like why like on the other hand there's another narrative um which seems to me to be like just as credible which is like it's actually new data sources that unlock deep learning right"
- "I think most people now are familiar with like quote the bitter lesson and the bitter lesson says is if you make an algorithm don't be cute yeah just make sure you can take advantage of available compute because the available compute will show up right and so like you just like need to like why like on the other hand there's another narrative um which seems to me to be like just as credible which is like it's actually new data sources that unlock deep learning right"
- "Visual spatial intelligence is so fundamental it's as fundamental as language possibly more ancient and and more fundamental in certain ways so so it's very natural for me that um world Labs is our Northstar is to unlock spatial intelligence the moment to me is right to do it like Justin was saying compute we've got these ingredients we've got compute we've got a much deeper understanding of data way deeper than image that days you know uh compared to to that those days we're so much more sophisticated and we've got some advancement of algorithms including"
- "Spatial intelligence is about machines ability to un to perceive reason and act in 3D and 3D space and time to understand how objects and events are positioned in 3D space and time how interactions in the world can affect those 3D position 3D 4D positions over space time um and both sort of perceive reason about generate interact with really take the machine out of the main frame or out of the data center and putting it out into the world and understanding the 3D 4D world with all of its richness so to be very clear are we talking about the physical world or are we just talking about an abstract notion of world I think it can be both I think it can be both and that encompasses our vision long term even if you're generating worlds even if you're generating content um doing that in positioned in 3D with 3D uh has a lot of benefits um or if you're recognizing the real world being able to put 3D understanding into the into the real world as well is part of it"
- "I think talking about the 1D versus fundamental 3D representation is one of the most core differentiation the other thing it's a slightly philosophical but it's really important to for me at least is language is fundamentally a purely generated signal there's no language out there you don't go out in the nature and there's words written in the sky for you whatever data you feeding you pretty much can just somehow regurgitate with enough generalizability at the the same data out and that's language to language and but but 3D World Is Not There is a 3D world out there that follows laws of physics that has its own structures due to materials and and many other things and to to fundamentally back that information out and be able to represent it and be able to generate it is just fundamentally quite a different problem"
- "I think this journey is going to take us places that we can't even imagine right now the magic of good technology is that technology opens up more possibilities and and unknown so so we will be pushing and then the possibilities will will be expanding"
- "I I don't think going to get there um I I think that this is such a fundamental thing like the universe is a giant evolving four-dimensional structure and spatial intelligence r large is just understanding that in all of its depths and figuring out all the applications to that so I I think that we have a we have a particular set of ideas in mind today but I I think this I think this journey is going to take us places that we can't even imagine right now"
