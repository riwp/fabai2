## SUMMARY

Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist, presents a simple 2-rule system for healthy eating to stay lean.

## IDEAS:
- Eating a high-fat, low-carb diet can help you gain muscle and lose fat.
- Insulin is the key to the fat cell; it opens it up and fills it with fat.
- To gain muscle and for your fat cells to grow, you need some insulin.
- If you have too much insulin, you store too much fat.
- You can eat plenty of calories to build muscle but store very little fat.
- It's very difficult to overeat on carbohydrates and protein.
- If you only ate protein and carbs, you would probably starve to death.
- Rabbit meat is so lean that if you ate an unlimited amount of it, you would die.
- You cannot live on a diet of just rabbit meat because it's too low in fat.
- You would have plenty of protein and food in your stomach but not enough calories.
- Carbohydrates and proteins together don't make you fat.
- Healthy fats are essential; without fats you can die.
- Essential fatty acids are essential, meaning your body cannot produce them.
- A very small percentage of society will be able to mix carbs and fats and not gain weight.
- The vast majority of society, if you mix fat and carbs together, you will gain weight.
- If you're going to mix carbs and fats, you've got to do calorie counting.
- There are methods that work for calorie counting but they can be tedious to follow.
- Skipping a meal a day and eating high carb, low fat is highly effective for staying lean.

## INSIGHTS:
- A high-fat, low-carb diet works because it keeps insulin levels low.
- Eating only protein and carbs is not sustainable for long-term health.
- Healthy fats are essential for survival.
- Most people gain weight when they mix carbohydrates and fats.
- Eating a high-carb, low-fat diet can be an effective way to stay lean.
- Avoiding simple sugars is key to staying lean on a high-carb diet.
- Focus on eating grains and potatoes on a high-carb diet.
- Enjoy your food, eat like a king, and you'll never be hungry or have cravings.
- Find a diet that works for you and stick to it.
- Listen to your body and adjust your diet as needed.
