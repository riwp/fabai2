# SUMMARY

This video presents CHEP releasing his new Cura 5 profiles, including a hyper fast profile.

# IDEAS:
- CHEP created a test print that has the Cura symbol and various letters.
- Cura 5.0 has some unique capabilities to control the line width when printing walls.
- CHEP's most popular profile now is his extra fast profile for Cura 5.
- CHEP has fixed the gaps in the top surface that were present in his extra fast profile.
- CHEP's extra fast profile is becoming his favorite profile to use for printing.
- CHEP had a jig that he made for soldering a circuit board, printed with extra fast.
- CHEP's viewer Sabretooth Turtle improved CHEP's extra fast profile to make it faster.
- CHEP experimented with Sabretooth Turtle's settings and produced a hyper fast profile.
- CHEP's hyper fast profile is strictly for a quick functional print.
- CHEP's hyper fast profile printed the test print in 22 minutes, 9 minutes faster.
- CHEP printed the soldering jig in 44 minutes with the hyper fast profile.
- CHEP's hyper fast profile print quality is not as good, but still not bad.
- CHEP is releasing his hyper fast profile as a beta since he is still playing with it.
- CHEP now has high quality, medium quality, fast printing, and hyper fast printing profiles.

# INSIGHTS:
- Cura 5 has new features that require profile adjustments to achieve optimal quality.
- There is a trade-off between print speed and print quality.
- Faster print profiles can save a significant amount of time.
- Functional prints do not always require high quality settings.
- Community collaboration can lead to improvements in print profiles.
- Continuous experimentation is key to optimizing print profiles.

# QUOTES:
- "i still don't feel i'm a hundred percent this is like maybe 99 percent of where i want to get to"
- "i think the 0.2 layer height is probably the best bang for the buck"
- "i don't think it's really worth the quality to get the best but on some prints it may be"
- "this extra fast profile is becoming my favorite profile to do pretty much anything now"
- "frankly i wasn't getting anywhere near as good a quality but he had some very interesting settings in there"
- "strictly for a quick print quick functional print you really don't care how good the top surface is although it's not bad"
- "that's almost a third faster and the quality definitely not as good but not bad"
- "again i would not call this the prettiest there's some little gaps in the base"
- "44 minutes i can go to lunch and come back and have a print ready to go"
- "man this is fantastic i now have high quality medium quality fast printing and hyper fast printing"

# HABITS:
- CHEP experiments with different settings to improve print quality and speed.
- CHEP listens to feedback from his viewers and tries their suggestions.
- CHEP is willing to share his profiles with the community.

# FACTS:
- Cura 5.0 has new features that affect print quality.
- 0.2 layer height provides a good balance between quality and speed.
- Reducing layer height increases print time.
- Print speed can be increased by adjusting print settings.
