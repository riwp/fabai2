- "i think the 0.2 layer height is probably the best bang for the buck"
- "i don't think it's really worth the quality to get the best but on some prints it may be"
- "this extra fast profile is becoming my favorite profile to do pretty much anything now"
- "frankly i wasn't getting anywhere near as good a quality but he had some very interesting settings in there"
- "strictly for a quick print quick functional print you really don't care how good the top surface is although it's not bad"
- "that's almost a third faster and the quality definitely not as good but not bad"
- "again i would not call this the prettiest there's some little gaps in the base"
- "44 minutes i can go to lunch and come back and have a print ready to go"
- "man this is fantastic i now have high quality medium quality fast printing and hyper fast printing"

# HABITS:
- CHEP experiments with different settings to improve print quality and speed.
- CHEP listens to feedback from his viewers and tries their suggestions.

# FACTS:
- Cura 5.0 has new features that affect print quality.
- 0.2 layer height provides a good balance between quality and speed.
- Reducing layer height increases print time.
- Print speed can be increased by adjusting print settings.

# REFERENCES:
- Cura 5
- Cura 5 profiles
- Hyper fast profile
- Extra fast profile
- CHEP's soldering jig
- Sabretooth Turtle's profile

- "The quest 3 is only 512 gigs there's no other option."
- "I wish third party controllers were announced a VR first controllers that are light good tracking minimal buttons and that allow you to grab drinks and things while using them."
- "I still think they're really really cool um but the longer recording would definitely do it for me."
- "The metaverse correctly done correctly is literally just an open space kind of like the internet that we have right now but in virtual reality."
- "I would love to say it's the thing is going to start getting smaller and thinner."
